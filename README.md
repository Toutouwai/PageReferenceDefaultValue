# Page Reference Default Value

Most ProcessWire core inputfield types that can be used with a Page Reference field support a "Default value" setting. This module extends support for default values to the following core inputfield types:

* Page List Select
* Page List Select Multiple
* Page Autocomplete (single and multiple)

Seeing as these inputfield types only support the selection of pages a Page List Select / Page List Select Multiple is used for defining the default value instead of the Text / Textarea field used by the core for other inputfield types. This makes defining a default value a bit more user-friendly.

Note that as per the core "Default value" setting, the Page Reference field must be set to "required" in order for the default value to be used.
